# MachineLearningComparisonDataMiningEC2019
This project is used to determine which of these machine learning algorithms would be the best to model the provided data. 

This is an attempt to take an early draft of a project and complete it. This draft is the most advanced draft saved after more complete versions were lost to file corruption or accidental deletion (I'm not sure which it was a long time ago). This repostitory is built to try to recreate the final product of this assignemnt and post a version of it that actually functions as adversitsed. 

This project will be edited over time to put it into a more complete form, it may at some point be temporarily abandonned if I am employed and no longer have time to work on it. 

Also to read geno.R please use CartayaTestCode.R as it is the only way to extract the data in a way that makes sense. I did not make this file but I uploaded it as it was necessary to run my own code. The file geno.R was created by Javier Cabrera at Rutgers Univeristy for any reference.
